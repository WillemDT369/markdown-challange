### You can always count on me for an honest opinion

## A funny story

When I was little my brother and I loved wathing the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. We liked 
to act like we where one of them. One day we wanted to climb out of the window 
with a rope with a hook attached to it. We made the hook ourselves from an 
iron wire. Not such a good idea since we were able to bend it. Conclusion, we fell out of the window.

### TL;DR

Falling out of an attic window with hook bent by 10 year old kids.
